This is a repository where in upload my recent updates. Many of thems are stubs, pieces of code that work well for a very especific purpose such as validating ID,
front end developments, back end scripts or ever more straightforward code like a Hello World.

I enjoy this way of life. I enjoy coding in order to challenge myself.
