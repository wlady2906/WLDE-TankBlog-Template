This is a repository where I upload my recent updates. Many of them are stubs, pieces of code that work well for a very specific purpose such as validating ID, front-end scripts, back-end scripts, or straightforward code like a Hello World.

I enjoy this way of life. I enjoy coding in order to challenge myself.
