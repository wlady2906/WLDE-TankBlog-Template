                    <p>It is well known that the designation of the name Tank refers to either tracked or wheeled vehicles
                        especialized in logistics and military operations. A tank is heavy-duty, capable, and reliable war machine
                        be able to deal with an exceptional warlike scenario.

                <h5>Reconnaissance Vehicle designed by the French Army During Cold War.</h5>
                <p>The EBR by French company Panhard is easily recognisable by its osculating turret, much like that of the AMX-13 tank and 4 of its 8 wheels being solid metal. The front and rear wheels are standard wheels with rubber tyres for whilst driving on the road and when going off-road the 4 central metal wheels were lowered to provide additional power, traction and reducing the vehicles ground pressure.
                    The vehicle also had 2 drivers. 1 stationed in the front as per normal and 1 in the rear.</p>

                <p>
                    Development of the Paladin Integrated Management program (PIM) started in 2007 with BAE Systems. In August 2009 the company was awarded a $63.9 million research and development contract to produce five SPG prototypes and two CAT (Carrier Ammunition Tracked) re-supply vehicle prototypes.
                    The SPG prototypes were later named Picatinny, Warren, Endicott, Minneapolis and York. The two CAT vehicles were named Aberdeen and Yuma.

                    BAE Systems delivered the seven  prototypes to the U.S. Army.

                    employed by the US Army.</h5>
                <p>
                    The Stryker has also received great support from US troops deployed in Iraq, who have found it to be a great replacement/substitute to the M998 (AKA Humvee) which was becoming increasingly vulnerable to IED attacks, as the number deployed and their explosive power has increased in recent years with a growing number of losses of life. The Stryker has proved less susceptible too these attacks and prevented the loss of life of US soldiers who would have been using the M998’s. By 2008 Stryker had clocked up 25 million miles of combat experience and 2550 Strykers had been delivered to the US Army. A contract for production and maintenance of 615 
                    Stryker vehicles was also placed in the same year.

                <p>Developed in the 1990’s, it was purchased by Jordan (50) in 2000 who surprisingly donated the lot to Iraq in 2004.

                    The upgrade focuses on the single-seated BAU-23×2 remote controlled weapon station (the gunner is located under the turret ring), which was developed by the Ukrainian SOE “Kharkiv Morozov Machine Building Design Bureau”.
                    
                    The weapon stations main armament is a pair of 2A7M, 23mm automatic guns, with a rate-of-fire of 850 rounds per minute, a range of 2000m and can store 200 rounds. The station has a full 360 degree traverse and elevation of the guns is -4 to +55 degrees, which means the vehicle can can not only engage 
                    ground targets, but aerial threats as well.</p>

                <p>
                    The Challenger 2 is an extensive redesign of the Challenger 1. Although the hull and automotive components seem similar, they are of a newer design and build than those of the Challenger 1 and only around 3% of components are interchangeable.[8] A visual recognition feature is the armoured housing for the TOGS thermal gunsight: the Challenger 2 has this above the gun barrel, the Challenger 1 has it at the right hand side of the turret. 
                    The tank's drive system provides a 550 km range, with a maximum road speed of 59 km/h.

                    It retains a turret, however a new one was developed where the main gun has been removed and the rear of the turret is converted into a raised structure which houses 
                    the two MICLIC launchers which each contain about 1,750 pounds of C4 explosives. When launched across a minefield the C4 is detonated to destroy land mines and clearing a path. The vehicle then drives along this and lay’s stakes in the ground to mark the cleared path.

                    Various equipment can be fitted on the front of the hull such as a plough or bulldozer blade to dig up roadside bombs and breach obstacles.

                    The launcher deploys a scissors-type bridge 60ft (18 m) long. Scissors-type bridges have the issue of that whilst unfolding, they vertically extend in to the air, this can be seen by the enemy if against a tree line, giving away the position of the crossing point and creating 
                    a high risk target. When retracting back on to the hull, it can be done at either end of the bridge. Deploying the bridge takes 2 to 5 minutes, and retrieval within 10 minutes under armour protection. As of 1996, the USMC had an inventory of 55 bridges and 37 launchers.
